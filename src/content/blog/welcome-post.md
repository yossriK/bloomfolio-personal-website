# Welcome to My Blog!

Hello and welcome! I'm excited to share my journey, experiments, and experiences in backend engineering and distributed system design.

## What to Expect

In this blog, you can expect:

- **Distributed system design tutorials** – from queues to load balancing and fault tolerance  
- **Backend engineering best practices** – scalable APIs, microservices, and database strategies  
- **Web development insights** – building modern, efficient web applications  
- **Project showcases** – practical case studies and code walkthroughs  
- **DevOps & cloud infrastructure tips** – CI/CD, Kubernetes, and deployment pipelines  

## About Me

I’m Yossri Khalil, a software engineer who enjoys designing systems that scale and performing deep dives into backend architectures. I graduated from the University of Calgary in Software Engineering (2022, GPA 3.7, Completed with Distinction) and have worked on projects ranging from fleet simulation systems like **Uber Sim X** to large-scale backend systems.  

I’m passionate about building reliable systems, optimizing performance, and learning new technologies that make software more resilient and maintainable.

## Let’s Connect
