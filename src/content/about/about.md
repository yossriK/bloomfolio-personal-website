I’m a **Backend / Systems Engineer** with experience building **distributed services, platform infrastructure, and real-time systems** across cloud and Linux-based environments.

My work spans **Rust, .NET, and TypeScript**, with a strong focus on **clean architecture, reliability, and scalability**. I’ve built and operated backend services running on **embedded Linux devices**, contributed to **authentication and identity platforms**, and designed **event-driven systems** using technologies like **Redis, gRPC, SSE, and message brokers**.

I enjoy working close to the system boundary—where backend services meet operating systems, devices, and networks—and I’m especially interested in **platform engineering, backend infrastructure, and large-scale distributed systems**.

When I am not coding you can find me hiking, exploring new venues around the city or simply enjoying a cup
of coffee
