- Developed **Rust-based backend services** running inside **distributed Snap packages** on Linux (Raspberry Pi), working directly with snap confinement, service orchestration, and inter-service communication.
- Standardized device-side services on **Axum**, improving API performance and long-term maintainability.
- Implemented **gRPC client/server communication** between device services and backend tooling for strongly-typed, low-latency interactions.
- Migrated internal messaging from **CBOR to Protobuf**, improving schema evolution and reducing parsing overhead.
- Owned the **online/offline device update pipeline**, including integrity checks and fallback logic, improving update success rates across multiple device types.
- Built **SSE-based real-time update clients** over HTTP and Bluetooth for low-latency device state synchronization.
- Improved **BLE communication reliability**, reducing test failures through better connection handling and recovery logic.
- Delivered manufacturing and provisioning APIs supporting firmware versioning, enrollment, and reset workflows.
